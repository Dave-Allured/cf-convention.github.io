# 2022 CF Training Workshop

The Climate and Forecast metadata conventions (CF) are a community-developed standard designed to promote the processing and sharing of climate and forecast model and observational output data, and derived data products. The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. The CF convention includes a standard name table, which defines strings that identify physical quantities.

2022 CF Workshop will take place on online on Thursday 08 September 2022, 15:00-1800 UTC.
