# 2022 CF Workshop

The Climate and Forecast metadata conventions (CF) are a community-developed standard  designed to promote the processing and sharing of climate and forecast model and observational output data, and derived data products. The conventions define metadata that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the spatial and temporal properties of the data. This enables users of data from different sources to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful extraction, regridding, and display capabilities. The CF convention includes a standard name table, which defines strings that identify physical quantities.

2022 CF Workshop will take place on 13-15 September 2022 hosted by [IFCA] at Santander (Spain). After 2 successful virtual editions ([2020] and [2021]), the 2022 edition is organized as a hybrid event having in-person and on-line participants.

**The full programme will be published on the CF website prior to the event.**

### Topics for hackatons sessions

We will devote the afternoon (CEST time) sessions of each day to focused-attention hackathons, during which it is hoped that concrete progress on each topic can be made (such as actual changes suggested to the Conventions text). 

Please express an interest in any number of these sessions, in the [registration form][REGISTRATION], or suggest a new topic that could be included, with a suggestion of who you think could lead the discussion. 

More details at: <https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues/152>
